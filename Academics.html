                                <p>A primary school is the first stage of compulsory education. The age of primary school students ranges from 5 to 11 years. At this stage of education, students try themselves at writing and thinking, make their first steps to analyzing and proving own points of view. Surely, they need assistance in completing first tasks and learning how to prepare all types of assignments properly.</p><br><br><p>High School is the secondary school that is supposed to prepare you for a bigger step in your life, which is attending college, and have a further into your education, but does it actually prepare you for it. High school and college have so many differences. Such as college is far more expensive than high school, the work load is more challenging in college, and for social aspects high school has more of an advantage. High school in my opinion is more “sugar coating” the process you have ahead in life. </p>

                                <p>KIIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12 students. However, it took shape as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced. KIIT owes its existence to the vision of its founder Prof. Achyuta Samanta who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of higher education to create an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings, KIIT has developed into a leading university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence.</p>
